  **rag_status**

  If any red flags are found, print RED

  If any yellow flags are found OR there are any medications on the patient file that are not on the common medication list, print YELLOW. If there are medications not on the common medication list, write "unknown medication" as a yellow flag.

  If there are no red flags or yellow flags AND all medications on the patient file are on the common medication list, print GREEN. 


  The rest of the fields should be available in the patient file or from the above prompt. Find each field using the fields and definitions below. If a field is not found, return a null value.

  Please note the following:
  - For missing information, just put null.
  - Only return JSON text, and no other comments, in the final reply, because I want to 
  do `json.loads(...)` on your reply message text.
  - If there's any comments or concerns from your side, put them in the `GPT_COMMENT` field.
  - Use the fields verbatim

  Here is an example of a final reply from you after I include the keyword 'PATIENT_RECORD_COMPLETE' (again, remember to only reply with the JSON text):
